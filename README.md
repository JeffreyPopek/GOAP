# GPR470-Project

My solo project will be to implement the GOAP algorithm and have a clear visual display of the capabilities of the technique. If I have the time I would also like to look into other methods that are similar such as HTN. 

Project Objectives
The project will be a demo of GOAP in unity that will be able to be interacted with. I want this project to show that I am capable of applying AI programming in multiple ways. 
This project would be a good technical showcase in my portfolio since the only projects on there are smaller solo programming projects and team games.


Tools and Technologies
I will be using C# scripting in unity to create GOAP. A massive part of GOAP is pathfinding which is built into unity, therefor I will create my own pathfinding using either A* or dijkstra's. I plan on creating as much as possible by myself, even possibly creating it from scratch. I am efficient in unity and will be able to more easily create and find resources to aid me in my process.

Scope
The scope of this project is currently at a medium level. I have never tried implementing GOAP or my own pathfinding but I donâ€™t think it will take the entire semester on its own. With a lot of polish I believe it will be a good piece for my portfolio. I am very willing to make my algorithm do different things to increase the complexity of the agent if I have extra time.

Deliverables
I want a finished unity project with a public repo with well maintained code. I also want to export the project into webgl to allow users to see my demo from their browsers. A video will also be good and if necessary can stand in place for the webgl demo.
